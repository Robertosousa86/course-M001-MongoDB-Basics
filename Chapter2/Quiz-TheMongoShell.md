# Quiz: The mongo shell

## Problem:
- Which of the following statements are true about the mongo shell?

## Answer

- It is a fully functioning JavaScript interpreter.

mongo shell is a fully functioning JavaScript interpreter, which means that you can create things like JavaScript functions and variables in it.

- It allows you to interact with your MongoDB instance without using a Graphical User Interface.

There are other means of interacting with the database, such as through the Atlas UI, which is more visually supportive than the mongo shell.
