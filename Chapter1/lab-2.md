# Lab: Connect to your Atlas Cluster

## Problem

- Now that you've set up an Atlas cluster, you can connect to it from the shell using the in-browser Interactive Development Environment (in-browser IDE). This environment lives in the browser, so you can complete these assignments without downloading and installing anything.

### Answer

SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE TO LOCATE THE IN-BROWSER IDE

For this exercise you will connect to your cluster from the shell.

Select "Connect" in the Atlas Cluster, and choose to "Connect with the `mongo shell`".

Select "I have the mongo shell installed", then Copy the connection string.

- Paste the connection string into the Terminal tab of the IDE space that is located on this page and establish a connection with your Atlas cluster by executing this connection command by hitting "enter/return" on your keyboard.

- You will be prompted to enter the password that you just created:

`m001-mongodb-basics`

- This terminal is a Unix machine, which means that when you type the password in nothing will display. This is normal. Everything that you are typing is still being recognized by the terminal.

- Hit "enter/return" on your keyboard after entering your password.

- This is a graded assignment. The only way to complete it is by establishing a successful connection with your Atlas cluster within the IDE that is provided to you on this page.

- You may get a warning that the version of the shell doesn't match the cluster version. That is not an issue for this course.
