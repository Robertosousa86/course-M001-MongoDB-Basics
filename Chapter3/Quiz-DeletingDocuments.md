# Quiz: Deleting documents

## Problem:
- The sample dataset contains a few databases that we will not use in this course. Clean up your Atlas cluster and get rid of all the collections in these databases:

*sample_analytics*
*sample_geospatial*
*sample_weatherdata*
Does removing all collections in a database also remove the database?

## Answer

**yes**

*When all collections are dropped from a database, the database no longer appears in the list of databases when you run show dbs.*
