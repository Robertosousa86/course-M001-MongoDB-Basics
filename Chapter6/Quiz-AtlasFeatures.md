# Quiz: Atlas features

## Problem:
- What actions are available to you via the Aggregation Builder in the Atlas Data Explorer?

## Answer

- Export pipeline to a programming language.
**You can choose to export the pipeline to one of four programming languages, and select to view the import statements that are needed in the application for this pipeline to work.**

- Syntax for each selected aggregation stage.
**When you select a stage the space to enter stage instructions has a syntax outline to help you recall what information the stage requires and in what format.**

- A preview of the data in the pipeline at each selected stage.
**There is a sample of data, or the whole result set to the right of every stage that uses correct syntax in the aggregation pipeline builder in Atlas.**
