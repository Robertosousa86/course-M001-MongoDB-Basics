# Quiz 3: What is a Document?

## Problem:
### In a MongoDB Document what is the role of fields and values?

## Answers

- A field is a unique identifier for a specific datapoint.

You can not have duplicate field names within the same level of a single document, which is why they are unique identifiers for a specific datapoint.

- Each field has a value associated with it.

Data is organized in field-value pairs, so each field has a value associated with it.
