# Lab: Connect to your Atlas Cluster

## Problem

- Now that you've set up an Atlas cluster, you can connect to it from the shell using the in-browser Interactive Development Environment (in-browser IDE). This environment lives in the browser, so you can complete these assignments without downloading and installing anything.

### Answer

SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE TO LOCATE THE IN-BROWSER IDE

For this exercise you will connect to your cluster from the shell.

Select "Connect" in the Atlas Cluster, and choose to "Connect with the ``mongo shell``".

Select "I have the mongo shell installed", then Copy the connection string.
