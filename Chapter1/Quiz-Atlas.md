# Quiz: What is Atlas?

## Problem:
- How is MongoDB Atlas related to MongoDB the Database??

## Answers

**_They are both MongoDB products._**

Atlas has many tools and services within it that are built specifically for the MongoDB Database.

**_MongoDB Database has the same functionality as Atlas, but without the friendly user interface._**

Atlas features go beyond the functionality of organizing and storing data, examples are Charts, Realm, Security features and more.
