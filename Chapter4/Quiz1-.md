# Quiz: $expr

## Problem:
- What are some of the uses for the $ sign in MQL?

## Answer

**$** _denotes an operator._

- All MQL operators have the $ prefix.

**$** _signifies that you are looking at the value of that field rather than the field name._

- When $ is used to prefix a field name, it represents the value stored in that field. This is very helpful for expressions that compare fields within the same document.
