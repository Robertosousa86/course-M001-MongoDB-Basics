# Quiz: What is Atlas?

## Problem:
### How is MongoDB Atlas related to MongoDB the Database?

## Answers

- They are both MongoDB products.

Atlas has many tools and services within it that are built specifically for the MongoDB Database.

- MongoDB Database has the same functionality as Atlas, but without the friendly user interface.

Atlas features go beyond the functionality of organizing and storing data, examples are Charts, Realm, Security features and more.
