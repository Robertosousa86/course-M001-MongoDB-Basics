# Chapter 4 IDE

## Problem:
- In this IDE space you can find two pre-populated text files:

- Contains all examples that were used in the lessons in this chapter.
Contains all the questions that you encountered in labs and quizzes throughout the chapter.
Use this space to:

- connect to your Atlas cluster,
- practice what you learned in earlier lectures,
- find answers to the quiz questions in this chapter.
Remember, it is easier to view documents in the shell when they look pretty()

_Good luck!_

- If you want to install MongoDB on your computer and use it locally instead of using this IDE environment consult our documentation for installation instructions for your specific Operating System. We will not be providing support for local installations in this course.

Solution: Delete the sample dataset then load a fresh one to complete the exercise. Be mindful of dataset changes as you are working on assignments in this course.**
